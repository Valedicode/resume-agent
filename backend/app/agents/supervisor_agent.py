Supervisor Agent - Orchestration Hub for Multi-Agent System

This agent manages the overall workflow:
1. Routes user requests to appropriate specialized agents
2. Manages CV and Job agents as tools (tool calling pattern)
3. Hands off to Writer agent for extended refinement sessions
4. Maintains conversation state and context
5. Handles clarification loops for CV extraction

Architecture:
- CV Agent: Tool calling (with supervisor-managed clarifications)
- Job Agent: Tool calling (data extraction)
- Writer Agent: Hand-off (extended collaborative session)
